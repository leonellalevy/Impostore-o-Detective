  ## Game-Pitch

  #I do not know yet what the name of this game will be 

•  Game idea  

I want to make a kind of escape room with a single player game inside of it. My game takes place in an abandoned place where a crime scene is present. The player must find clues to find what happened and who is the killer. The problem is that he is not an actual detective, but a citizen not allowed to enter this place. Each clue the player finds in the crime scene, the police find him, and he must escape them to continue looking for more clues. The game takes its end when the player finds all the clues that were necessary to find who is the killer and prove the police that he can be a detective.  

• Scenario and characters description (include placeholder graphics, drafts, references)  

The player character description will be determined later. The police characters will have police clothes. The scenario takes place in a crime scene. So, there will be some blood, the clues and a room as a background, that is all a decided for now.  

• Characters’ actions and goals  

The player character can go to the left, right, up, and down when it is in the crime scene. It can also jump when it comes to dope the obstacles. The player’s goal is to find clues and not be caught by the police. Police characters are just following the player character.  

• Game Win/Lose conditions  

There will be a time limit to find a clue. If the player does not find it, he loses and must start again. Also, when the player is escaping from the police, there will be obstacles in his way. If he does not correctly dodge the obstacles, he becomes closer to the police. If this situation happens two more times, he is caught by the police. The player will win the game when he finds all the clues to find who is the killer.  

• Progression of levels  

There are not really levels because it depends on which clue it is found first. If there is a way to always show the same game scenario no matter which clue is found, levels can be made and there will be more obstacles and the game will be quicker each time the level goes up. 

• Sources of inspiration (other games, movies, etc. that inspired your idea)  

I was inspired by the movie Prison Break and by the Game Subway Surfers
